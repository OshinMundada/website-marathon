# website-marathon
This website lets users register for a marathon. 
It uses AJAX to verify that the form submitted is not a duplicate, 
PHP validations, 
PHP script to read form paramters, 
and MySQL database to store data.
Lastly, we generate a roster of runners grouped by category and alphabetized by last name.
